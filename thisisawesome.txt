does Uber really need the extra marketing?
Your office probably doesn’t have a slip ‘n slide. And running through the sprinklers likely won’t go over well with your boss. Don’t sweat it. You can still feel like a kid again by ordering ice cream on demand with #UberIceCream.

HOW IT WORKS

Open Uber between 11am - 5pm on Friday, July 24

Set your location and request ICE CREAM

If connected, five frozen treats from Three Twins will be delivered curbside for $25.

ask Lily, she’s getting very sick of me barraging her with food questions
Probably won’t be, but that was so good
I hope it’s that Indian food again
whats tomorrows food?
/giphy food
okay, buzz killington
so if we all presented as a group, it would be very short
naw i think it’s 4 minutes per presentation rather than 4 minutes per person
well there’s 10 of you down there, 40 minutes should be enough to pitch the show and air the pilot.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXKn3ZmxEfs>
btw free food tomorrow wooohooo
HAHA
which is way longer than it takes you or Nik to get to free food
we’d only get 4 minutes
have everyone present as a group
Our Summer Project: Food Wars
we should pitch that during the intern presentations
think we could make Tripit Food Wars into the next big reality show?
so maybe the best option is to lie low and wait to see if free food pops out in a bit
i think someone in the office got free chicken though
naw dawg. got screwed out of it
i thought you got free chicken?!
/giphy cereal
/giphy good choice
good choice
im comin chowdaaaah

plugdj can use both youtube and soundcloud on the same platform and it gives you rooms where you can take turns playing music with your friends
because everyone else can hear it

?
how is that dif from just playing directly from scloud/
you can import your soundcloud playlist into <http://plug.dj|plug.dj> and then play your music for everyone in the room
i'm on soundcloud!

my manager and HR are both confused with TimeForce lol. Apparently everyone used workforce before this
<@U06H91W91>: email your manager, I emailed mine and went through a thread convo with the HRSystems people. Your manager will need to email them the date and exact hours if you punch in.

I'm not really sure... I just did exactly what Sarah said to do and I figure it will get fixed  if it's wrong
Wait do we count overtime for those days? During out timeforce meeting last week they said just count it as 8 hours flat...
thanks christina!
I ended up with a little bit of overtime on Monday and Tuesday too
oh yeah haha i forgot the shuttle took forever
Yeah I said I got to the hotel at 5 though, I remember it took a long time (and I'm rounding up a little haha)
so my flight was at 1 and then we got to the hotel around 4 right? so just those hours for sunday?
okay sweet thanks for asking!
Hey guys, I emailed Sarah Coke about logging our hours from Bellevue, here's what she said: 

You would enter the exact hours that you spend flying up until the time you arrived at the hotel. You would log the time you arrived at Concur on Monday until 5PM. Same for Tuesday. Let me know if you have additional questions. :simple_smile:

yeah of course! come over to the marketing team's area whenever and we can go :smiley:

Cool, we can take a peek at the food truck outside on our way out too
SO is closer. Let’s leave for SO at 12!
That's cool with me!
Mind if I crash this lunch party? I’m down to eat anything
but i am down for anything!
someone sent me this link for the calendar of the food trucks out front, it doesn't really say what they are but here's what they sent me: <http://sfgcjm.com/calendar/>
or if you guys want sandwiches, <http://www.yelp.com/biz/two-sons-sandwiches-san-francisco?osq=lunch>

You have to sign up with TimeForce to log your hours, I think they e-mailed us a link to it
Did they ever tell us how to log hours?

does Uber really need the extra marketing?
Your office probably doesn’t have a slip ‘n slide. And running through the sprinklers likely won’t go over well with your boss. Don’t sweat it. You can still feel like a kid again by ordering ice cream on demand with #UberIceCream.

HOW IT WORKS

Open Uber between 11am - 5pm on Friday, July 24

Set your location and request ICE CREAM

If connected, five frozen treats from Three Twins will be delivered curbside for $25.

no indian food!!!
ahhhahahahh
ask Lily, she’s getting very sick of me barraging her with food questions
Probably won’t be, but that was so good
I hope it’s that Indian food again
whats tomorrows food?
/giphy food
okay, buzz killington
so if we all presented as a group, it would be very short
naw i think it’s 4 minutes per presentation rather than 4 minutes per person
well there’s 10 of you down there, 40 minutes should be enough to pitch the show and air the pilot.

btw free food tomorrow wooohooo
HAHA
which is way longer than it takes you or Nik to get to free food
we’d only get 4 minutes
have everyone present as a group
Our Summer Project: Food Wars
we should pitch that during the intern presentations
think we could make Tripit Food Wars into the next big reality show?
so maybe the best option is to lie low and wait to see if free food pops out in a bit
i think someone in the office got free chicken though
naw dawg. got screwed out of it
i thought you got free chicken?!
/giphy cereal
/giphy good choice
good choice
im comin chowdaaaah

oh okay, gotchia. I wonder which academy has better perks; the sith or the jedi
so those are all minions
they’ve also had multiple pairings, and then they kill one group off… Sith can’t be trusted
and they always kill each other off lol
but to be an actual sith lord which is the highest there can only be on and his apprentice
academies*
they have had students and acadmies before
those aren’t technically sith lords
: help
wait. I thought that there can only be one sith lord and apprentice, so why are there so many red lightsabers?

might as well put it on
I like retro
but im listening to my music… what you guys would call retro im sure.

join the room! Nik’s DJing right now
thats very cool actually.
hmm
plugdj can use both youtube and soundcloud on the same platform and it gives you rooms where you can take turns playing music with your friends
because everyone else can hear it
j wondering not being sarcastik
?
how is that dif from just playing directly from scloud/
you can import your soundcloud playlist into  and then play your music for everyone in the room
i'm on soundcloud!
join my room! play some music for us :smile:
i have!

have you guys tried ?
why don’t we listen to some music?

/giphy Tuesday
I'm not really sure... I just did exactly what Sarah said to do and I figure it will get fixed  if it's wrong
Wait do we count overtime for those days? During out timeforce meeting last week they said just count it as 8 hours flat...
thanks christina!
I ended up with a little bit of overtime on Monday and Tuesday too
oh yeah haha i forgot the shuttle took forever
Yeah I said I got to the hotel at 5 though, I remember it took a long time (and I'm rounding up a little haha)
so my flight was at 1 and then we got to the hotel around 4 right? so just those hours for sunday?
okay sweet thanks for asking!
Hey guys, I emailed Sarah Coke about logging our hours from Bellevue, here's what she said: 

You would enter the exact hours that you spend flying up until the time you arrived at the hotel. You would log the time you arrived at Concur on Monday until 5PM. Same for Tuesday. Let me know if you have additional questions. :simple_smile:

does Uber really need the extra marketing?
Your office probably doesn’t have a slip ‘n slide. And running through the sprinklers likely won’t go over well with your boss. Don’t sweat it. You can still feel like a kid again by ordering ice cream on demand with #UberIceCream.

HOW IT WORKS

Open Uber between 11am - 5pm on Friday, July 24

Set your location and request ICE CREAM

If connected, five frozen treats from Three Twins will be delivered curbside for $25.

no indian food!!!
ahhhahahahh
ask Lily, she’s getting very sick of me barraging her with food questions
Probably won’t be, but that was so good
I hope it’s that Indian food again
whats tomorrows food?
/giphy food
okay, buzz killington
so if we all presented as a group, it would be very short
naw i think it’s 4 minutes per presentation rather than 4 minutes per person
well there’s 10 of you down there, 40 minutes should be enough to pitch the show and air the pilot.

btw free food tomorrow wooohooo
HAHA
which is way longer than it takes you or Nik to get to free food
we’d only get 4 minutes
have everyone present as a group
Our Summer Project: Food Wars
we should pitch that during the intern presentations
think we could make Tripit Food Wars into the next big reality show?
so maybe the best option is to lie low and wait to see if free food pops out in a bit
i think someone in the office got free chicken though
naw dawg. got screwed out of it
i thought you got free chicken?!
/giphy cereal
/giphy good choice
good choice
im comin chowdaaaah

so those are all minions
they’ve also had multiple pairings, and then they kill one group off… Sith can’t be trusted
and they always kill each other off lol
but to be an actual sith lord which is the highest there can only be on and his apprentice
academies*
they have had students and acadmies before
those aren’t technically sith lords
: help

might as well put it on
I like retro
but im listening to my music… what you guys would call retro im sure.

join the room! Nik’s DJing right now
thats very cool actually.
hmm
plugdj can use both youtube and soundcloud on the same platform and it gives you rooms where you can take turns playing music with your friends
because everyone else can hear it
j wondering not being sarcastik
?
how is that dif from just playing directly from scloud/
you can import your soundcloud playlist into  and then play your music for everyone in the room
i'm on soundcloud!
join my room! play some music for us :smile:
i have!

have you guys tried ?
why don’t we listen to some music?

my manager and HR are both confused with TimeForce lol. Apparently everyone used workforce before this
: email your manager, I emailed mine and went through a thread convo with the HRSystems people. Your manager will need to email them the date and exact hours if you punch in.

I'm not really sure... I just did exactly what Sarah said to do and I figure it will get fixed  if it's wrong
Wait do we count overtime for those days? During out timeforce meeting last week they said just count it as 8 hours flat...
thanks christina!
I ended up with a little bit of overtime on Monday and Tuesday too
oh yeah haha i forgot the shuttle took forever
Yeah I said I got to the hotel at 5 though, I remember it took a long time (and I'm rounding up a little haha)
so my flight was at 1 and then we got to the hotel around 4 right? so just those hours for sunday?
okay sweet thanks for asking!
Hey guys, I emailed Sarah Coke about logging our hours from Bellevue, here's what she said: 

You would enter the exact hours that you spend flying up until the time you arrived at the hotel. You would log the time you arrived at Concur on Monday until 5PM. Same for Tuesday. Let me know if you have additional questions. :simple_smile:
/giphy alone

Did they ever tell us how to log hours?
