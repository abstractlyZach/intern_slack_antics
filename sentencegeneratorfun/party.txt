twitch plays gsc, but its not the real deal
just copycats 
not nearly as popular as the official one
twitchplayspokemonplaystetris is a stream where the inputs for twitchplayspokemon are inputted into a game of Tetris
its hilarious!
also, the blocks can move up
so sometimes you just have tetris blocks floating around forever
Jonathan Wang

I heard about All Terrain Venomoth vs Lances Dragonite
there was like a 25 level gap
in Dragonites favor
but ATV poisoned Dragonite and used Agility over and over again
Zach Lee
2/28, 8:43pm
Zach Lee
gen 1 AI is programmed to only use super-effective attacks, which were Psychic
and the only Psychic attacks it knows are barrier and agility
so All-Terrain Venomoth won by poison
and tickle damage
